    <hr>
    <p>In my CHS Web Design/Development class, we created virtual machines for the purpose of keeping our files and work separate from each other and the students in other classes. Our instructor provided us with a master system to make our VM's from.</p>
    <hr>


    <p>To start, using the master VM provided, we made a copy of it. This copy was provided my Mr. McClendon. </p><img src="images/pics/VMachMake.png" style="width: 2000px; height: 400px">

  <p>During the cloning process, we made sure to clone everything in the machine in its current state</p><img src="images/pics/VMach2.png" style="float: left; width: 900px; height: 675px"><img src="images/pics/VMach3.png" style="float: right; width: 900px; height:675px">

  <p>After cloning, we then backed up our VM as an Ova to the cloud. My choice of cloud services was Microsoft Onedrive.</p><img src="images/pics/VMach4.png" style=" float: left; width: 900px; height: 675px"><img src="images/pics/inthecloud.png" style="float: right; width: 900px; height: 600px">

  <p>At long last, came the time to customize my VM. During this process, I used sudo passwd change to change the password on the VM from the default compsci, to something else (which shall not be revealed). I also proceeded to change the background to a Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask Background</p><img src="images/pics/custombackground.png" style="float: left; width: 900px; height: 675px">
